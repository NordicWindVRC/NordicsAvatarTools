# Changelog — Nordic's Advanced Atlaser

Newest first. Versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org). Early versions were numbered as
"Revision N", which corresponds to version `0.N.0`. Not released yet.

## 0.40.0 — unreleased

EditMode tests pass in Unity 2022.3.22 (2026-11-03).

### Changed
- Package and NDMF name `app.nordicwind.advanced-atlaser`. Requires Texture Wrapper 0.9.0 or
  later, because of the renamed runtime assembly.
- The NDMF plugin class is renamed `NordicsAdvancedAtlaserPlugin`. The AAO integration define
  is renamed `NORDIC_ADVANCED_ATLASER_HAS_AAO`. Tests use namespace
  `NordicWind.AdvancedAtlaser.Tests`. MIT license.
- Build errors start with `[Nordic's Advanced Atlaser]`.

### Fixed
- Global mask textures were reported as ordinary masks and missing from the global masks.
- `AtlasGlobalMaskResource.MappingFor()` returned null for a resource without a texture.
