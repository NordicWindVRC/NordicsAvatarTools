# Changelog — Nordic's Advanced Atlaser

Newest first. Versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org). Early versions were numbered as
"Revision N", which corresponds to version `0.N.0`. Not released yet.

## 0.40.0 — unreleased

EditMode tests pass in Unity 2022.3.22 (2026-11-03).

### Changed
- Package and NDMF name `app.nordicwind.advanced-atlaser`. Requires Texture Wrapper 0.10.0 or
  later, for the renamed runtime assembly and the normal correction safety rules.
- The NDMF plugin class is renamed `NordicsAdvancedAtlaserPlugin`. The AAO integration define
  is renamed `NORDIC_ADVANCED_ATLASER_HAS_AAO`. Tests use namespace
  `NordicWind.AdvancedAtlaser.Tests`. MIT license.
- Build errors start with `[Nordic's Advanced Atlaser]`.

### Added
- **Normal correction never makes shading worse.** The bake paints a coverage map per UV
  winding and uses the Texture Wrapper's safety rules: overlapping UVs (mirrored halves, stacked
  copies) get no correction, and corrections above 60° fade out. One summary line per material
  says how much was left uncorrected. One warning per material only when at least 1% of the
  correction hit the 60° limit, which points to a mismatch between the meshes.
- `AtlasColorProcessingDefinition.TintMode`: *Multiply* or *Perceptual* (keeps lightness,
  takes the tint's hue, scales chroma by the tint's saturation, mixes in by its alpha).
  Poiyomi 10's tint is perceptual.

### Fixed
- With *Export Intermediate Maps* on, the tangent-frame maps were exported (which normalizes
  them) before the normal correction bake, so debug builds baked slightly different
  corrections. They're now exported after the bake.
- Poiyomi saturation was copied unconverted, so an untouched material (saturation 0) read as
  fully grey. It is now `1 + value`, the unified scale.
- Poiyomi brightness is mapped per version: additive for 7.x and 8.x, a multiplier of
  `1 + value` for 9.x and later. 7.x to 9.x always clamp after brightness, so `ClampOutput` is
  set for them.
- Poiyomi saturation was read twice, by two parsers. Only the version-aware one is left.
- Global mask textures were reported as ordinary masks and missing from the global masks.
- `AtlasGlobalMaskResource.MappingFor()` returned null for a resource without a texture.

## Pre-release history

| Version | Summary |
|---|---|
| 0.39.0 | Blend-shape geometry exclusion with a threshold and *Any* / *All Vertices* mode per entry. Normal corrections use full dilation. |
| 0.38.0 | Nested AAO Merge Skinned Mesh sources are discovered. |
| 0.37.0 | Fixed a hang at 4096² caused by a per-pixel loop after dilation. |
| 0.35.0 | Configurable normal-correction padding (later replaced by full dilation). |
| 0.34.0 | Optional exclusion of geometry moved by selected blend shapes. |
| 0.33.0 | Pose-aware geometry capture, without requiring AAO. |
| 0.32.0 | Geometry correction in avatar-root space. Requires Texture Wrapper 0.8.3. |
| 0.30.0 | Debug menu: verbose logging, intermediate map export and build summary. |
| 0.29.0 | Material-centric geometry baking across all original renderers. |
| 0.28.0 | Original geometry captured early in the build. Capture diagnostics. |
| 0.24.0–0.26.0 | Unified material model: input parsers for Standard, VRChat Mobile, Mochie and Poiyomi 7–10, global masks, and Poiyomi inspector mappings. |
